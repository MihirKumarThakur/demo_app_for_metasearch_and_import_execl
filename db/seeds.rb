# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# 50.times do 
# 	Employee.create(department_id: rand(1..5), ssn: 1_000_00 + Random.rand(10_000_00 - 1_000_00), name: Faker::Name.name, phone_number: 1_000_0 + Random.rand(10_000_00 - 1_000_00), address: Faker::Address.street_address, salary: 1_000_005 + Random.rand(10_000_00 - 1_000_00) )
# end



	# Department.create(department_name: "finance", department_id: 1, department_location: "new delhi" )
	# Department.create(department_name: "IT", department_id: 2, department_location: "Mumbai" )
